The next morning, I made coffee like I always do. The machine hissed and clicked, loud and impatient, but this time I heard it.
I stood at the counter, holding the cup with both hands. The first sip still burned a little. The same bitter heat. But something felt steadier. Or maybe I just wasn’t fighting it.
The stain on the counter was still there. So were the coffee grounds, the post-its, the unfinished sketchbooks, the quiet loops. None of it had changed. But I noticed them differently now, not as failures, not as reminders, but as facts.
I didn’t wipe the counter. I didn’t have to.
I opened the sliding door and walked into the studio, carrying the mug. The sunlight was softer today, filtered through light gray clouds. The rectangle on the wall had disappeared, but the mark I’d made with the charcoal remained, a single line, faint, like a thought that hadn’t decided whether to stay.
I didn’t feel the need to add to it.
I didn’t feel the need to erase it either.
I turned on the screen again. The Door resumed from black, the figure walking, entering, walking. I didn’t look away. I watched the loop all the way through, even though I already knew what came next.
It wasn’t asking for anything.
It was just doing what it does.
Later, I sat at my desk, cleared a small patch of space, and opened a sketchbook. No intention. No grand idea. Just movement. A curve. A few marks. A shadow falling across the page. I stopped before it felt finished. I didn’t go back.
There was still so much undone. A proposal I needed to finish. A piece I needed to hang. An email I still hadn’t answered. But they could wait. Everything could wait, for just a little longer.
In the afternoon, I went outside for a walk. Just to breathe. Just to move. The red T-shirt was still tangled on the laundry line. A child dropped a toy, picked it back up without looking, and kept walking. The ferry left the dock slowly, carving a soft V in the river.
I stood there for a moment, watching the water fold into itself, endlessly opening and closing.
And then I turned away.
I walked to the corner store to buy a new box of incense sticks. The owner nodded at me like he always does. I nodded back.
Back home, I lit one. I didn’t think about what it symbolized. I didn’t think about what came next. I just let the smoke curl into the room, soft and unhurried.
In the evening, I turned off the lights in the studio and let the last of the natural light fade without replacing it. I sat in the dim and watched as the dark arrived, quietly, without fuss.
I remembered a line from a book I had read years ago, something I had underlined but never quite understood until now. “To continue is not the same as to repeat.”
I whispered it aloud, just to feel it leave my mouth.
That night, I slept.
Not deeply. Not for long.
But without resistance.
