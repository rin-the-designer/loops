That night, after the critique, I couldn’t sleep.
I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, watching the shadows shift as cars passed outside. The conversation from earlier replayed in my head on loop. Snippets of praise, loose analysis, wine-softened words about “intention” and “emotional density.” I had said too little and nodded too much. I remember laughing at a joke I didn’t find funny.
Everyone meant well. They always do.
Still, I felt like I had been performing the idea of an artist more than being one.
Around 3 a.m., I got up and went back into the studio. I didn’t turn on the overhead light. Just the screen. The Door flickered back to life, the corridor pulsing faintly in the dark. The figure was still walking, still opening, still going nowhere.
I sat in front of it for what felt like an hour.
Then I unplugged it.
It was the smallest act of resistance I could think of. Not permanent. Not destructive. Just… off. The screen faded to black, and the room felt a little heavier. Like it had lost something essential.
The next day, I tried to start fresh. I pulled out a new canvas. Rearranged the furniture. Swept the floor for the first time in weeks. I told myself I was making space for new thoughts, new energy, new possibilities. I even considered switching mediums entirely. Maybe photography. Maybe performance. Maybe no medium at all.
But by mid-afternoon, I was sitting in the same chair, staring at the same spot on the wall, drinking the same coffee.
The canvas stayed blank.
That evening, I deleted all the playlists I had been looping for years. Made a new one filled with songs I didn’t know. I hoped the unfamiliarity would jolt me out of something. Instead, it just made the silence between songs more obvious.
I didn’t sleep well that night either.
The following day, I left the apartment without any plan. I took the train uptown, got off somewhere random, and walked until my legs ached. I passed closed storefronts, empty churches, playgrounds filled with kids who had no idea how strange it is to be alive. I watched a man on the sidewalk sell fake designer bags to no one in particular. I sat on a bench outside a hospital and watched people come and go, faces tight with hope or grief or exhaustion.
It should have made me feel something. It didn’t.
I kept walking.
At one point I found myself standing in front of a mirror in a bookstore bathroom. My eyes looked tired. My shoulders slumped forward. I stared at myself for a long time, waiting for the reflection to blink first.
It didn’t.
Back in the studio, I tried again.
I pulled up untitled5.mov, the Escher staircase loop. I slowed the frame rate, added a sound layer, my own breathing, recorded and distorted. I thought it might feel new. But the steps still led back to the beginning. The breathing sounded like wind in a sealed room.
It felt like trying to scream underwater.
That night, I stayed up sketching frantically. Page after page. Circles, squares, patterns, unreadable symbols. None of it made sense. That wasn’t the point. I just wanted to move my hand. I fell asleep on the floor, pen in hand, curled next to a pile of paper that looked like the aftermath of a failed ritual.
The next morning, I woke up sore and unsatisfied.
I lit my incense again. Burned it all the way this time. The smoke rose steadily, obediently, disappearing into the air like it had someplace better to be. I stared at it until my eyes blurred.
I thought about calling my mom. I thought about texting an old friend from school. I thought about leaving the city altogether. I even looked up flights for a moment—Tokyo, Cape Town, somewhere with clean light and unfamiliar streets.
I didn’t book anything.
I stayed.
By the fourth day, I started to laugh, quietly, bitterly, like someone who finally got the joke halfway through the second act.
That afternoon, the sun came in harder than usual. I had left the blinds open without thinking. The light stretched across the studio floor, climbing up the canvas I’d left untouched all week. It landed in a clean rectangle on the wall, the only space I hadn’t cluttered or marked.
The white was blinding. Almost holy.
I stood there watching it for a long time, eyes squinting against the glare. It wasn’t the beauty of it, exactly. It was the fact that it had always been there, waiting. The light moved so slowly it almost looked still. And somehow that was the most moving part.
I stepped into the patch of light. Warmth spread across my bare arms, my neck. A bead of sweat gathered near my collarbone. I stayed there, letting it soak into me, soft and steady.
And then, without thinking, I picked up a piece of charcoal from the floor and made a mark on the wall, just one. A single line, across the middle of the light.
It didn’t mean anything.
It didn’t have to.
Maybe that was the point.
Not to escape the spiral.
But to meet it.
To draw the same line again, this time knowing I’d drawn it before.
