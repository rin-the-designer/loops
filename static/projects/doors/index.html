          Doors act as gateways that allow us to move through space, much like
          the transitions we experience in life. We enter and exit different
          phases, and each doorway transforms who we are. Just as an infinite
          stairway ascends through these transitions, we progress from child to
          adult, student to professional, and beyond as each role shapes our
          identity with every step.
        </p>

          The alternating black and white doors symbolize the ongoing cycle and
          duality of existence, such as life and death, light and darkness, and
          beginnings and endings. As we walk through this unending corridor of
          doors, we witness how each transition reshapes us and guides us toward
          our next transformation. The journey continues infinitely, reminding
          us that every ending is simply the start of a new beginning.
