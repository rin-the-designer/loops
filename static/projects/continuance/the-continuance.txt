I’ve stopped looking for breakthroughs. These days, I just move through the hours as they come.
I still make my coffee every morning. The machine still groans and hisses. The espresso still stops short.
But now, I take a moment to smell it. To watch the swirl before it settles.
I’ve started wiping the counter again—not every day, just sometimes. Not to reset anything. Just to see the surface beneath.
In the studio, I don’t try to start over anymore. I just continue.
The painting by the window now has one more circle, off-center, slightly smudged. I haven’t sanded it off yet. Maybe I won’t.
The screen plays its videos again. I let it be. It no longer feels like it’s asking a question. Just showing a rhythm.
Step. Open. Step. Open. Repeat.
I’ve begun finishing things, too. Not perfectly, not quickly. Just enough.
The sculpture wrapped in cloth is out now. I added one more piece to it last week. I’m still not sure what it is, but I no longer mind not knowing.
Most nights, I sleep. Not always well. But well enough.
And in the mornings, when the light slants across the floor, I sometimes sit in it again, letting the warmth catch on my skin. I don’t reach for meaning. I just let it be light.
I don’t think I’ve escaped anything. But I’ve stopped running. The loop is still here. The spiral still winds.
But it feels less like a trap now.
More like a path I know how to walk.
And when I draw the line again, on paper, in thought, in motion, I do it without expecting it to lead anywhere new.
That, in itself, feels new.
