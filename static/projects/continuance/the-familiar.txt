I dripped my coffee this morning, just like every other morning. It tasted exactly like yesterday’s. The machine coughed and hissed, loud and impatient, a sound I’ve grown used to, so much so that I don’t even hear it until it’s finished. I leaned against the kitchen counter, watching the espresso collect in the cup. It always stops just a little short of full. I never bother to press the button twice.
Even when I’m running behind, I wait. This ritual doesn’t care about time, and neither do I, not in the morning. The first sip burns slightly, the way it always does when I’m too eager. I don’t grimace anymore. I just drink.
There’s a faint ring of coffee grounds around the machine, and a small brown stain on the counter where I always set my cup. I’ve stopped noticing them, really. Some mornings I wipe them. Most mornings I don’t. I tell myself it’s part of the texture of the space. That, or I’ve just decided that effort isn’t worth it in a place where the same mess appears again the next day.
The studio is connected to the apartment by a single sliding door, but it feels like a border crossing. On one side, the ordinary, predictable mornings with a noisy coffee machine. On the other, a space that’s supposed to be unpredictable, spontaneous, inspired. But lately, it feels more like another ordinary space — just a quieter one.
The light had already begun slanting through the blinds when I stepped in. Soft, pale lines stretching across the floor and up the blank side of a canvas leaning against the far wall. The painting has been there for a while now. Still untitled. Just a bunch of circles of black acrylic paint, on a blank canvas, which I keep adding to and sanding off. It’s become less a painting and more a diary of indecision, or another ritual perhaps.
Across the room, a screen glowed with a silent loop—The Door, a piece I made last spring. A visual of an endless corridor of black and white doors, each one opening to the next. Sometimes I forget it’s even playing, but today it caught my eye. The repetition is perfect, seamless. The code is clean. The meaning, uncertain.
People often tell me that my work is “meditative.” It’s a word they use when they don’t quite know what to say. “Your loops are so calming,” they’ll say, or “It’s nice to stand still in front of something that doesn’t ask too much.” I used to take it as a compliment. Lately, I wonder if it’s just another way of saying, You seem stuck, but at least it’s beautiful.
I moved on to my studio ritual, lighting an incense stick. I had one half-finished from yesterday. I don’t know how it got into my head, but the sight of it, charred halfway, leaning in its little dish, reminded me of how I leave my own work half-finished. A bunch of post-its on the wall, a sculpture wrapped in cloth, a line of code paused mid-animation. Sometimes I stop just to see if I’ll care enough to return. Most of the time, I don’t.

My desk, against the far wall, was cluttered with the usual suspects: charcoal smudges, a bunch of wirings, sketchbooks I hadn’t opened in days. A crumpled artist statement draft sat in the corner, scribbled with marginal notes I barely recognized. Except for one phrase that was readable, “Repetition as resistance, or surrender?”
I didn’t remember writing that.
It was almost 10:00 a.m. I had a studio visit at noon. Someone from a small residency program downtown. I wasn’t nervous, but I wasn’t exactly prepared either. I’d probably say what I always say: that I’m interested in cycles, systems, the tension between control and freedom. I’d gesture vaguely at the loops and sculptures and try to sound thoughtful. They’d nod. Maybe take a photo. Maybe ask if I’d considered adding sound.
There’s a rhythm to these interactions too. Everyone is playing their part. Everyone is looping.
My phone buzzed once. A calendar reminder. Critique at 7 p.m., a small group. We’d gather in someone’s apartment, drink some vin chaud, and talk about “intentions.” I’d sit on the floor, knees pulled in, listening to people fellow artists trying to explain the ineffable. Most of the time, we’re not trying to be profound. We’re just trying not to feel alone in our work.
Sometimes, that’s enough.
I took another sip of coffee. It had cooled. The bitter edge was gone, replaced by something flatter, duller. I set it down next to a dried paintbrush and looked out the window. The building across the street had laundry lines running along every balcony — socks, bedsheets, a red T-shirt swaying slightly in the breeze. I wondered if the person who hung it out even noticed it anymore. If they still looked for color in their own routines.
Sometimes I think I’m too close to my life to understand it. When I zoom in, everything feels purposeful. I can point to a drawing, a sentence, a small decision and say: Yes, this is what I meant. But from afar, it all starts to blur. The gestures, the days, the work, it's just a loop. Not in neat circles, but in long spirals that bend and twist without direction.
I used to think I was moving forward. Now, I’m not so sure. Maybe I’m just drawing the same line over and over, hoping it becomes something new.
Still, I get up every morning. I drip the coffee. I wait.
