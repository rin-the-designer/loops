It was a small thing, really.
An email, sitting quietly at the top of my inbox when I checked after breakfast.
The gallery had decided to “pause” our planned show for the fall. No real explanation, just a few sentences about shifting priorities, budget cuts, “hope to collaborate in the future.” I read it twice. Maybe three times. It didn’t sting. It didn’t even surprise me. It just floated there, detached, another message among hundreds. Another unopened door.
I closed the laptop without replying.
This wasn’t the first time. It happens all the time. One day they’re enthusiastic, talking about how my project could be a meaningful addition to their collection. The next, they turn around and move on, offering vague reasons, calling it a “pause.” I’ve stopped expecting more than that.
For a few minutes, I stood in the middle of the studio, not quite sure what to do next. I looked around. The incense had burned itself out to a thin pile of ash. The canvas by the window caught a pale band of light. The Door was still looping, the figure walking endlessly through black and white thresholds.
Sometimes I forget it’s even playing, but now the loop felt louder, somehow. More absurd. The endless walking. The endless opening.
I pressed my thumb against the rough wood of the window frame, grounding myself. Outside, life moved on like it always does. A man in a blue jacket trudged past the laundromat, pulling a cart stacked with plastic bags. Two teenagers on bikes wove between traffic, laughing too loudly. An old woman with an orange umbrella stood waiting at the corner, though the sun was out.
Everyone was moving, going somewhere. It all looked familiar. It all looked strange.
I went back to my desk and picked up a mechanical pencil, out of habit more than intention. I stared at the sketchbook lying open, its blank page absorbing the late morning light. I drew a small circle, then another, then stopped. The marks felt weightless, uncommitted. I closed the book.
I opened it again five minutes later, just to be sure. Same result.
There’s a particular flavor of stillness that settles in on days like this. Not peaceful stillness, not rest. The other kind—the kind that buzzes underneath your skin, that makes the air around you feel too thin, too brittle. A stillness that keeps your hands busy but your mind elsewhere.
I wandered the room like a ghost inventorying my own life. Half-finished clay forms on the side table. A pile of notes I meant to organize last week. Sketches pinned to the wall with no particular order. Everything was suspended, unfinished, waiting for a permission I couldn’t grant.
At lunchtime, I ordered a sandwich from the shop downstairs and forgot about it until the delivery guy buzzed three times. I ate standing up at the counter, chewing mechanically. The taste was gray and salty. I threw half of it away.
The laundry lines across the street had shifted slightly. The red T-shirt was tangled now, wrapped awkwardly around the line, flapping half-heartedly in the breeze.
I watched it for a while. I don’t know why.
Sometime in the afternoon, I sat on the floor and opened a folder of old video sketches—loops, fragments, small experiments I had abandoned over the past year. I clicked through them one by one.
A hand drawing itself endlessly.
A door opening and closing in slow motion.
A ripple expanding over water that never stills.
I had made all of these once with a kind of urgency, convinced they meant something important. Watching them now, they seemed to dissolve into each other. Same gestures, different surfaces. Same questions, slightly rearranged. There was one file titled untitled5.mov, a five-second loop of a figure climbing a staircase that folds back into itself, like an Escher drawing. I remember staying up all night working on it, obsessing over the timing of the steps.
It made me tired to watch it now.
At some point, I remembered the studio visit scheduled for noon. I checked my phone: no new messages. Maybe they forgot. Maybe they canceled. Maybe they came, knocked once, and left.
The idea didn’t bother me.
The studio smelled faintly of burnt incense and stale coffee. I didn’t light another stick. I didn’t make another coffee. I just sat there, feeling the afternoon stretch thin around me.
Around four, I took a slow walk to the riverside. The streets buzzed with the end-of-day rhythm, construction workers piling tools into trucks, office workers rushing into delis, delivery bikes weaving around cars.
Everyone moving. Everyone repeating. Everyone except me.
I bought a cheap bottle of water from a cart and sat on a bench facing the water. Ferries moved back and forth across the river like slow stitches sewing the two sides of the city together. I watched the surface ripple and fold and open again. I thought about emailing the gallery back. Saying something professional, polite. I thought about starting a new piece. I thought about quitting for the day.
I did none of those things.
I just sat there, watching the ferries, drinking lukewarm water from a plastic bottle, feeling the slow pulse of the loop carry me along.
By the time I got back to the studio, the sun was almost down. The blinds cast thicker shadows now. The loops on the screen looked darker, the corridor of doors sinking into blackness. My phone buzzed once. A reminder for the critique at 7 p.m. A group of fellow artists, a few bottles of wine, a long circle of talking and nodding and offering half-formed encouragements.
Most of the time, we’re not trying to be profound. We’re just trying not to feel alone in our work. I turned off the screen but left the room dark, just for a moment.
The city hummed outside.
The faint smell of smoke clung to the air.
I stood there, still holding the empty water bottle, thinking about all the doors I had walked through today without noticing.
