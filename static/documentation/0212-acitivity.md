# Thoughts on Writing

I know what I want to have in my paper, and I know the form that I am choosing. It is going to take the structure of a tech documentation, but the contents won't necessarily be tech heavy nor tech oriented. It is going to have text on where the project came from, where I'm going with this, what I'm trying to convey, and how I would like this work to be interpreted. It will also contain technical details on how I built it and the interaction of each piece.

I will also have a brochure(if possible) for the general audience and the visitors that are at the show.
