# The Loops

_The Loops_ is a collection of screen-based interactive sketches about being stuck in cycles and noticing where, if anywhere, you actually have a choice. Each sketch runs as a loop with no clear beginning or end: nothing levels up, nothing unlocks, and there is no hidden goal. Instead, touch and motion inputs nudge simple systems that keep resetting, drifting, or resisting your control. The Loops doesn't offer an answer or an escape; it just gives you a place to sit inside repetition long enough to see what it's doing to you, and what you might do back.
